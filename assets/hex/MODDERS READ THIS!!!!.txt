Heya! Kade here.

I'm going to leave this note for people modding hex. Heres some tips on the cutscene system.

Its like week 6's but it has 3 new commands! (techn 5)
:bf: = boyfriend speaking
(ex. :bf:hello world!)
:hex: = hex speaking
:gf: = gf speaking
:myst: = ??? speaking

heres the 3 new ones though
:BGCHANGE:
Background change. It allows you to change the current background TO ANYTHING (anything in hex/images/)
(ex. :BGCHANGE:stageback (leads to assets/hex/images/stageback.png REMEMBER TO NOT INCLUDE THE FILE extension!))
:PLAYSOUND:
play a sound lol. (anything in hex/sounds)
(ex. :PLAYSOUND:bzzt (leads to hex/sounds/bzzt.ogg))
:BGTRACK:
changes the background track. this defaults to givin a little bit back.
(ex. :BGTRACK:givinALittle (leads to hex/music/givinALittle.ogg))


I HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS MOD.
love you
