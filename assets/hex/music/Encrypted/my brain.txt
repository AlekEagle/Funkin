The code to unlock is a simple as a thought.
The button code is the only thought.
As old as video games a sacred cheat code.
The old arcade stand starting with a K, ending with a tsunami.

Maybe this will unlock the files of truth.
Or maybe this is another false lead, who knows.

Input the code at the screen that lightens your eyes with yellowy dye.
Go find the secret, in the button that takes you to purple.

Select the secret and enjoy the fruit of your efforts.

- A lost robot with no voice.
